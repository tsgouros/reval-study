The data used in this study was the assessor's tax roll data for 2003-2023, inclusive, downloaded from <https://data.providenceri.gov/browse?q=Roll>. The site is a little opaque, so you can get it all at once from <https://sgouros.com/finance/reval-study-data.tgz> and unpack it here with `tar xzf reval-study-data.tgz`.
